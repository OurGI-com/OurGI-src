#singularity is far more convenient than docker, so replace docker with singularity

apt install ca-certificates
ssh root@my_vps_1_ip
wget https://github.com/OurGI-com/OurGI-src/raw/master/singularity/singularity.zip
unzip singularity.zip
sudo cp singularity /usr/local/bin/singularity
sudo cp singularity.conf  /usr/local/etc/singularity/singularity.conf
sudo cp starter /usr/local/libexec/singularity/bin/starter
mkdir -p /usr/local/var/singularity/mnt/session
echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib non-free' >> /etc/apt/source.list
apt update
apt -t buster-backports install libseccomp2

#now we can use it:
singularity build -s debian-test-1/ docker://debian:buster-slim
singularity build -s debian-test-2/ docker://debian:buster-slim
sudo singularity shell --writable debian-test-1/
sudo singularity shell --writable debian-test-2/

#It takes me only 2 minutes now I have 2 debian environments, I think it's "VPS in VPS".
#and I can zip/backup the debian-test-1 and debian-test-2 directories very convenient and intuitively compared to docker.
